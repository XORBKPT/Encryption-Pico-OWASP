# Crypto-Zero-QR

This system is designed for electrical engineers working in high-voltage environments, offering a simple graphical interface, AES-256 encryption, and QR code generation—all while remaining air-gapped for security. It’s compliant with ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP, and NIST standards, and it’s structured to be deployed by an apprentice with basic Linux knowledge

Overview
This secure messaging system allows engineers to:

Input short messages (up to 256 characters).
Encrypt them using AES-256-CBC.
Generate QR codes for scanning with smartphones in airplane mode.
Display the QR codes on-screen with a user-friendly graphical interface.
The system replicates and improves upon an existing Windows-based tool, leveraging the Raspberry Pi Zero’s portability for use in multiple locations with just screens and keyboards. It’s offline, secure, and designed for minimal interaction—perfect for a stressful, high-voltage environment.

Key Features
Security: AES-256-CBC encryption, no hardcoded secrets, secure key/IV storage, and logging for auditing.
Graphical UI: Built with Tkinter, featuring a clean interface clickable even with gloves (no live graph included, as it wasn’t specified as critical).
QR Code Format: Uses medium error correction for reliability, with potential to upgrade formats as graphical capabilities improve.
Compliance: Adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 (audit logging, least privilege), OWASP (input validation), and NIST SP 800-53 (error handling, permissions).
Ease of Use: One-click QR code generation via a desktop shortcut.
Project Files
Here’s what you’ll need to set up and deploy the system:

secure_messenger.py: Main script for the GUI, encryption, and QR code generation.
config.ini: Stores the encryption key and IV (securely generated by the apprentice).
install_dependencies.sh: Installs required Python libraries.
setup_autostart.sh: Optional script for autostart on boot.
secure_messenger.desktop: Desktop entry for manual launching.
README.md: Detailed setup and usage instructions.
Setup Instructions
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi Zero
MicroSD card (32GB recommended)
Monitor, keyboard, and mouse
Optional: Small display for portability
Software Setup
Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite:
Download from the official site and flash it to the microSD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.
Insert the card into the Pi Zero and boot it up.
Initial Configuration:
Log in (pi/raspberry).
Run sudo raspi-config:
Change the password.
Enable Desktop Autologin under System Options > Boot / Auto Login.
Reboot: sudo reboot.
Install Dependencies:
Copy all files (e.g., via USB) to /home/pi.
Run:
bash

./setup_autostart.sh
Usage
Start the System:
Double-click the Secure Messenger icon on the desktop.
Enter a Message:
Type a message (max 256 characters) in the text box.
Generate QR Code:
Click “Generate QR Code” to display the encrypted QR code.
Scan:
Use a smartphone in airplane mode with a standard QR scanner to capture the code.
Decrypt Later:
At lunch, go online to resolve the QR code (if needed), then decrypt at the next station with another Pi Zero.
Security and Compliance
ISO/IEC 27001: Audit logging in /var/log/secure_messenger.log, least privilege with the pi user.
OWASP: Input validation, no hardcoded credentials.
NIST SP 800-53: Secure file permissions, robust error handling.
Enhancements
With the improved graphical capabilities over the old Windows terminal, you could explore:

Higher QR Code Versions: Increase data capacity or error correction (e.g., version=2 or ERROR_CORRECT_H in qrcode.QRCode).
Custom Styling: Adjust box_size or colors in the QR code for better visibility.
Troubleshooting
No QR Code Displays: Check config.ini for correct key/IV lengths.
Errors: Review /var/log/secure_messenger.log.
GUI Issues: Ensure python3-tk is installed and Desktop Autologin is enabled.
